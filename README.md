# Low Cost VIS/NIR Spectrometer
We are a team of three students as part of Glasgow University's ENG5026 Design Special Topic 5. This class puts students in groups to initially design a proof of concept and ultimately a product in collaboration with research taking place at the University.

We aim to design a miniaturised, low-cost visible light and near-infrared spectrometer in a handheld form-factor to analyse fruit ripeness and other VIS/NIR applications including use in schools and universities. Existing products are found in the range of between Â£400-1000 and we aim to produce an alternative which will be more affordable and accessible.

Currently, the project consists of a custom RP2040 microcontroller board with an e-paper display to minimise power draw. The spectral sensing will use AMS-OSRAM's spectral sensor chips which has shown positive results in testing but in order to provide a more robust and elegant solution, additional funding will allow us to experiment with better sensors. The AS7265x triad sensors will give the widest possible range of sensing while still being affordable to the end user.

As well as being low-cost, it is an aim of the project to achieve long battery life for portable use. This is why low-power design such as battery management and an e-paper display has been at the forefront of component choice.

The final output (a PCB with surface-mount components pre-assembled) will be very low-cost, but we require funding for prototyping and testing various spectrometer chips, battery management, microcontrollers, and LEDs.
